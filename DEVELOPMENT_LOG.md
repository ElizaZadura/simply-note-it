# Simply Note It - Development Log

## Project Overview
**Goal**: Build a custom text editor with split panels that runs natively on Windows (via WSL development)

**Current Status**: ✅ **WORKING** - Basic text editor with split panel functionality implemented

## Tech Stack
- **Language**: Python 3.12.3
- **GUI Framework**: tkinter (native Python GUI)
- **Platform**: WSL2 → Windows (GUI forwarding)
- **Dependencies**: None (pure Python standard library)

## Current Working Version
**File**: `main_simple.py` - This is the working version
**File**: `main.py` - Original version with panel management issues (not working)

## ✅ Features Implemented

### Core Editor Features
- ✅ Native desktop app (runs in WSL, displays on Windows)
- ✅ File operations: New, Open, Save, Save As
- ✅ Edit operations: Undo/Redo, Cut/Copy/Paste, Select All
- ✅ Find functionality with text highlighting
- ✅ Custom key bindings (Ctrl+N, Ctrl+O, Ctrl+S, Ctrl+F, etc.)
- ✅ Font size adjustment (8-24pt)
- ✅ Status bar with file information
- ✅ Unsaved changes detection
- ✅ Monospace font (Consolas) with proper tab stops

### Split Panel Features
- ✅ **Split Horizontal** (Ctrl+Shift+H) - Creates horizontal split
- ✅ **Split Vertical** (Ctrl+Shift+V) - Creates vertical split  
- ✅ **Close Split** (Ctrl+Shift+W) - Closes current panel
- ✅ **Panel Navigation** (Ctrl+Tab / Ctrl+Shift+Tab) - Switch between panels
- ✅ **Up to 4 panels** with automatic layout reorganization
- ✅ **Independent file editing** in each panel
- ✅ **Panel indicators** in window title

### Layout Options
- 1 panel: Full screen
- 2 panels: Side by side
- 3 panels: Top + bottom split
- 4 panels: 2x2 grid

## 🎯 How to Run
```bash
cd /home/elz/dev/simply-note-it
python3 main_simple.py
```

## 🚫 What Didn't Work

### Rust + egui Approach
- **Issue**: Extremely slow compilation (30+ minutes for simple cargo check)
- **Problem**: Heavy dependencies, edition conflicts, WSL performance issues
- **Decision**: Abandoned in favor of Python approach

### Original Python Implementation
- **Issue**: Complex panel management causing widget destruction errors
- **Problem**: Tkinter widget lifecycle management
- **Solution**: Simplified approach with better panel tracking

## 📋 Next Development Priorities

### High Priority
1. **Syntax Highlighting** - Add basic syntax highlighting for common languages
2. **File Tabs** - Add tab system for multiple files per panel
3. **Macro System** - Basic macro recording/playback
4. **File Merging** - Simple diff/merge functionality

### Medium Priority
5. **Custom Themes** - Dark/light theme support
6. **Plugin System** - Basic plugin architecture
7. **Advanced Search** - Regex search, replace functionality
8. **Auto-completion** - Basic word completion

### Low Priority
9. **Performance Optimization** - Large file handling
10. **Advanced Features** - Multi-cursor, advanced selection
11. **Export Options** - PDF, HTML export
12. **Configuration** - Settings file, preferences

## 🔧 Technical Notes

### Panel Management
- Uses `self.panels` list to track all text widgets
- `self.current_panel` tracks active panel index
- `reorganize_panels()` handles layout changes
- `pack_forget()` instead of `destroy()` for better widget management

### Key Bindings
- All standard editor shortcuts implemented
- Split panel shortcuts: Ctrl+Shift+H/V/W
- Panel navigation: Ctrl+Tab / Ctrl+Shift+Tab

### File Management
- Each panel can have independent files
- `self.current_file` tracks main file
- Unsaved changes detection per panel

## 🐛 Known Issues
- None currently identified in working version
- Original `main.py` has panel management bugs (use `main_simple.py`)

## 🎉 Success Metrics
- ✅ Native desktop app running on Windows
- ✅ Split panels working correctly
- ✅ All basic editor features functional
- ✅ Custom key bindings working
- ✅ File operations working
- ✅ Fast startup and responsive UI

## 💡 Lessons Learned
1. **Python + tkinter** is much more practical than Rust + egui for this use case
2. **WSL GUI forwarding** works well for development
3. **Simpler approaches** often work better than complex ones
4. **Widget lifecycle management** is crucial in tkinter

## 🚀 Ready for Next Session
The project is in a great state to continue development. All core functionality is working, and the next features to implement are clearly defined.
